		Cattle Overview
	</h2>
	<p id="details">
		European cattle are large herbivores typically raised as livestock for 
		the production of beef, veal, dairy products, and leather. Females are 
		typically referred to as cows and the males, bulls. Cattle are 
		quadrapedal animals with cloven hooves that originally have horns. 
		Genetic selection has resulted in the widespread existence of hornless 
		cattle that are now raised on farms. They possess a digestive system 
		specialized for the consumption of plants with a stomach divided in to 
		4 compartments. Feeding involves swallowing the food unchewed until the
		 creature finds a safe place to regurgitate the food and chew it 
		thouroughly before swalling it again.

	<h2>
		Cattle Behavior
	</h2>
	<p id="details">
		Cattle behavior varies depending on whether it's a cow or bull. Cows 
		are typically friendly and curious. Cows that deal with humans more 
		regularly are less prone to agitation when interacted with. Negative 
		experiences will impact their behavior as well, so cows who dealt with 
		humans in the past in less than ideal circumstances are likely to be 
		more hostile.
		</br></br>
		Bull behavior is generally hostile as they are highly aggressive by 
		nature. While bull fighting often has a matador waving a red cape to 
		provoke the bull, they are unable to actually see the colors of it and 
		are triggered by the movement of the cape instead.
		</br></br>
		Cattle in general dislike surprises and change with a strong preference
		 for routines and familiar faces. They are also highly social creatures
		 so leaving them isolated will severely stress the animal.
