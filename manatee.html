		Manatee Overview
	</h2>
	<p id="details">
		Manatees are large aquatice herbivores often referred to as sea cows. 
		They can be up to 4 meters long and weigh roughly half a ton. The tails
		 and flippers of manatees are paddle shaped and they often propel 
		themselves slowly through the water. Their diet consists of a large 
		variety of freshwater and saltwater plants. Adult manatees typically 
		eat 10-15% of their own weight everyday resulting in them spending as 
		much as 7 hours of their day just eating.

	<h2>
		Manatee Behavior
	</h2>
	<p id="details">
		Manatees are very similar in nature to cows. They are typically slow 
		and curious creatures whose main cause of death is human interference. 
		Some manatees bear numerous scars from boat propellers and many die 
		from collisions with boats and ships. About half of the day is spent 
		sleeping underwater with short breaks for air.
		</br></br>
		Unlike cows, manatees are relatively solitary creatures. They are seen 
		together most frequently when a male follows a female or a mother is 
		accompanied by their offspring.
