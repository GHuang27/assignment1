		Hippopotamus Overview
	</h2>
	<p id="details">
		The hippopotomus is a large semiaquatic mammal that is generally 
		herbivorous. They outwardly resemble massive hairless pigs, but have 
		wide mouths housing large canine tusks. Despite their barrel-like 
		builds, hippos are capable of sprinting up to 30 km/h. Their diet is 
		mostly composed of grass and some aquatic plants, but there have been 
		occasional sightings of hippos eating meat and some cannibalism. This 
		was likely anomalous behavior as their composition isn't suited for 
		digesting meat.

	<h2>
		Hippopotamus Behavior
	</h2>
	<p id="details">
		Unlike cattle and manatees, hippos are highly aggressive and 
		unpredictable animals often regarded as one of the most dangerous 
		animals in the world. They are fiercly territorial in the water, but 
		less so on land. As a result of their large builds and aggressive 
		tendencies, hippos are not usually preyed upon in the wild. Aside from 
		the odd hippo falling to a number of crocodiles, hippos often kill or 
		drive alligators out of their habitats.
